# Erdos-Straus-Programs
Programs to check primes for the erdos-straus conjecture

## tests.py

Current program is used to print all working fn's that lead to a unit fraction for a particular prime.
The current program is only set up to work for primes in the form of 4n + 1

Parameters that can be modified:
- Upper limit for the numerator of fn
- Upper limit for the denomenator of fn, only denomenators in the form 2^n will be tested
- Upper limit for d 
- List of fns to highlight in the output
- If the output should be written to a text file or printed to the console

### To Do List
- [ ] Allow user to specify folder where files will be written
- [ ] Add separate program to test if number is prime
- [ ] Allow option to generate output for a certain family of primes
